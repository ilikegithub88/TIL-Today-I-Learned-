# TIL-Today-I-Learned-

## TIL definition
 It means that I upload information every time I learn something or fix errors. Fixing errors might be regared as learning something, though.

## TIL details
My TIL repository has a variety of things, especially Ecmascript. It is because I usually focus on languages based on Ecmascript. Vanilla JS, React, Node JS are my priorities.
Of course, my TIL repository has other kinds of information like Markdown grammars. 

## TIL titles
I have named the titles of documents like '20200701'. I have tried to emphasis that I give a commit to github every day. That is why my markdown documents are titled according to calendar dates.
